# Parity Filter Info #

----------

This filter is used to set blocks in even or odd positions within the selection box.
It was made because I had the Idea and felt like making it (aka I was bored).

If you see a star next to an option this means that there is a bit of information that you need to know about to use this feature to its full potential. All of this information can be found on the Notes Tab. [SEE](https://i.imgur.com/qn9DLuB.png)
