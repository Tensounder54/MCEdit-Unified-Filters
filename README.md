## What are Filters ##

Filters are plugins for MCedit, a Minecraft world editor, that allow users to write scripts to extend the features of the world editor.

The latest version of MCedit can be found [here](http://www.mcedit-unified.net/).

## How this works. ##

I currently have 4 complete filters here:

 - Defoliation Filter V2
 - Parity Filter V3
 - Make Honey Pots Filter V1
 - Wool CTMify V1

To download a filter go to its folder and click on the `.py` file. Then right click the "Raw" button and click "Save Link As..." then navigate to your filter directory.
