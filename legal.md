##Info##

Please don’t attempt to make money off of my filters. Use these filters however you want as long as it is for a non-commercial use and is legal in your country. Furthermore please give me credit if you modify or use pieces of a filter somewhere else. There are otherwise no restrictions on the usage of these filters.

All of my filters are open source and will be available as long as Google/GitHub has active servers.
